# Stocks Analysis
## Project Overview
The client, Steve, requested that we refactor the stocks analysis workbook prepared for him. To ensure that the workbook is robust and efficient independent of the dataset size, the workbook was refactored to look for speed and code efficiency improvements.

## Results
### 2017 and 2018 Comparison

### Code Refactor
Initially, the stocks analysis code executed in 0.7 seconds as shown in the figure below.

After refactoring, the 2017 and 2018 run times improved, as shown in the two image below.

The primary refactor modification was to implement arrays for the output variables, looping through and outputting as arrays. This is different than the output methodology shown below. 

## Summary







Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
